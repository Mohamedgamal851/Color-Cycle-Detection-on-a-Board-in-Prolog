# Color-Cycle-Detection-on-a-Board-in-Prolog
Detect cycles of the same color (Red, Yellow, or Blue) in an N x M board using uninformed search. A cycle is a sequence of at least four adjacent cells forming a closed loop. Implement the search to find and print any such cycle or indicate if none exist. Include board input, state representation, moves, and output.
